= v 1.x =

This branch consists of simple user interface shortcuts to the official blogmarks.net web site.

It seems all necessary features are implemented today. 
Only bug fixes and translations might be added in the future.

= v 2.x =

This branch is a total rework of the current extension.
 * browsing the blgomarks is fully integrated in the menubar (using ajax to dynamically load the blogmarks)
